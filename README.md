Rally 2012 Hackathon
PSI Completeness App

Introduction

My name is Cedric Lignier. I am the Customer Product Owner for Rally at Yahoo in charge of the adoption and rollout of Rally within our organization.
I'm partnering with Kyle from Rally Software as part of the Rally Hackathon to learn more about the Rally SDK and how our organization can leverage it to meet specific needs.

For a litte bit of context, early in 2012, our company decided to adopt an adaptive planning process to address a longstanding misalignment between strategy and agile team execution. Business Units are implementing the program level of this Scaled Agile Framework (under the label of "Adaptive Planning") and already launch Agile Release Trains

The hack that we are working is aimed to facilitate the decision making process for program managers and leaders running Agile Release Trains of what changes might be necessary to successfully deliver the PSI. We are building reports that provide insights on the progress being made for a given PSI (what rally refers as a "release") available at any given point of time.

Demo

What does our app do? (For the second video)
 - It provide for a give PSI the prioritized list of features, by focusing on the most important feature at the top
 - Show the current progress made on this feature along with an feature healthy status indicator to help management steering the PSI.
 - Leveraging the power of the Rally SDK 2.0, we can apply the same concept at the team level to provide similar insights for individual teams within minutes
